dart-rails
----------

This is something special if you know rails and [dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

dart-rails is a gem that aims to provide dart support in rails applications. Its sourcecode
is published at [github](https://github.com/m0gg/dart-rails) and as the former owner of dart-rails
gem on [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) handed over ownership, it's now first published at
version `0.2.2`. The latest patchlevel `0.2.4` fixed some minor issues concerning the assets generator.

Usage of the gem got quite simple, the README on github should be sufficient. I've also published an example
application [dart-rails-example](https://github.com/m0gg/dart-rails-sample) which i need to update.
